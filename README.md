# Cook-It Recipe Website

Cook It is a recipe website that I developed as my final project for the "Web Development" course at IT School. It's designed to help users discover and explore a wide range of culinary delights. The website allows users to find recipes based on the ingredients they have, encouraging creative and sustainable cooking while reducing food waste.
